# Google data analytics Capstone cyclistic case study
Data driven case study analyzing Cyclistic's bike-share usage to identify strategies for converting casual riders into annual members. This includes data cleaning, analysis and visualization.

## Introduction
This case study explores how Cyclistic, a bike-share program in Chicago, can convert more casual riders into annual members using data-driven insights. By analyzing ride patterns, trip durations, and user behaviors, we'll uncover trends that inform targeted marketing strategies.
In this project we are applying real-world data skills to solve a business challenge. The insights gained here can help shape promotional campaigns, pricing strategies, and overall service improvements.

## Background

### Scenario
My role as a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic involves helping the marketing team increase annual memberships. We'll analyze how different customer groups use our bikes to develop a targeted marketing strategy. Our findings, supported by strong data and visuals, will be presented to executives for approval.
